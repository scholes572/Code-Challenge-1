# Code-Challenge-1 🚀
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript challenges which are :(Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator ☕,Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator 🛵 and finally a Simplified Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator 📱)designed to strengthen logic building and user interaction with `prompt()` and console output.
Each folder contains a mini-project focused on solving a real-world problem with simple calculations and clear output.
